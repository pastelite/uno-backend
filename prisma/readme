ok, I have to think about how the project should basic_controller

It's the shitty uno backend that can play uno. so let's decide something

1. this project does not need security. I will not save password and userdata will be deleted
when the lobby close. this mean no back up is required since why would i do that.
2. since above is the case, jwt seem like a good idea
3. any player in lobby can access room info, players, turn, and card on the top of deck
4. there will be no card history since why would we need that
5. if card on desk run out there will be a shuffle in db, shuffle will be automatic
6. only the player can see card on their hands

ok then let's implement it
